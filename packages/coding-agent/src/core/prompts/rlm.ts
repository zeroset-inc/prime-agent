Compaction removes individual variables whose serialized form exceeds 16 MiB; keep large source data on disk and reload it when needed.",

Evaluate external systems through their own interface, then use the REPL to coordinate the process and analyze what comes back.",

Use `h.pid` / `h.running` for liveness, `h.tail(n)` / `h.output()` for combined stdout+stderr so far, `h.poll()` for a non-blocking result, `h.kill()` to terminate (SIGTERM, escalating to SIGKILL; on Windows kill() uses taskkill /T and detached or reparented descendants may survive), and `await h` (or `await bash('cmd')`) for the completed result with exit_code, output, and duration. Prefer bash() for long-running commands so the turn keeps working. Run shell commands with `bash()`, not `subprocess`/`os.system`: subprocess calls block the kernel, show the user nothing while they run, and spawn processes the harness cannot see or stop.",

	"Important: do not install dependencies into the kernel just to make an external project import or run there. If a project import, test, script, CLI, or dependency check is needed, run it through that project's own environment and normal command interface. For example, in a Python repo use its documented commands, `uv run ...`, `.venv/bin/python ...`, or the active project interpreter from the repo root. Treat failures from that native environment as the relevant result.",

	"Python state in the kernel persists across cells: named variables, helper functions, classes, imports, notes, parsed outputs, and helper data structures all remain available in every later turn.
