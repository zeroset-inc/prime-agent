/**
 * Append-only JSONL event log: the shared crash-safety substrate under the
 * RLM spawn ledger and the ACP semantic-edge ledger.
 *
 * Appends are single O_APPEND writes (PIPE_BUF-scale sizes, whose atomicity
 * multi-writer consumers rely on for interleaving), fsynced only when the
 * caller needs durability. Replay tolerates exactly one torn FINAL line
 * (rejected by the consumer's parser AND unterminated: a crashed writer's
 * in-progress append) and fails closed on any malformed interior line.
 * Repair happens only on append, never on read — a viewer may replay a live
 * writer's log. EVERY unterminated tail is truncated at its byte offset,
 * even one that parses as JSON: completing it with a newline would turn a
 * line a strict consumer parser rejects into permanent fail-closed interior
 * poison. Unifying consumers keeps the union of their safety behaviors.
